Going through the exercises from the [O'Reilly book](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920000570.do) by Casey Reas &amp; Ben Fry using [p5js.org](http://p5js.org)

The original Processing example programs from the book are included in the latest version of Processing: click the File menu, choose examples, and click GettingStartedBook.  

You can download Processing from [http://processing.org/](http://processing.org/)

This repository contains code examples from the book converted into[p5js.org](http://p5js.org). To best understand these code examples follow along in [the book ](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920000570.do) where the authors go through and clearly explain the functionality and structure of each example.

These p5js examples can be viewed on this repository's [github pages](http://josephfiola.github.io/GettingStartedWithProcessing/)
